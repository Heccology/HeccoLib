# HeccoLib version 1.1.1

## Changes
- Fixed many issues with automatic datagen of block families
- Fixed the mod simply not working on NeoForge
- Added a "planks" method in BlockFamilyCreator, which adds the block to the planks item and block tags

## New Features
- Added contributor capes for TheHecco, Yirmiri, _Artyrian, tellio_ari, Diemond_Player, and WorkGoblin
  - Will only show if no other cape is enabled
- Added a datagen class for item tags
  - Auto generates item tags for block family blocks
- Added a datagen class for block loot tables
  - Auto generates a default loot table for all blocks in a mod
  - If a loot table is added for a block before the method runs, it will override the default one
